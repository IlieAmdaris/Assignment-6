I wasn't entirely sure how to fix the issue we've been talking about
but since the programm works the way  I understood it should,I will leave it as
is for now,perhaps after I prepare more for the test I will get the right idea.
I am sending it now though, so that in case you find something else wrong with it,I have time to fix it
Have a good day.
